# Glioma_classification_and_survival_prediction
Master thesis 
This thesis deals with a classification of glioma grade in high and low aggressive tumours and overall  survival  prediction  based  on  magnetic  resonance  imaging. <br> Data  used  in  this  work  is from <b>BRATS challenge 2019</b> and each set contains information from 4 weighting sequences of MRI. <br> Thesis  is  implemented  in  PYTHON  programming  language  and Jupyter  Notebooks environment. Software PyRadiomics is used for calculation of image features. <br> Goal of this work is to determine best tumour region  and weighting sequence for calculation  of image features and consequently select set of features that are the best ones for classification of tumour grade and survival prediction. Part of thesis is dedicated to survival prediction using set of statistical tests, specifically Cox regression. <br>

Big part of the thesis is destinated to visualize the most most descriptive features for distinguishing the class of the tumour. Images comes from <i>3DSlicer, GIMP </i> or <i>ImageJ</i><br>
